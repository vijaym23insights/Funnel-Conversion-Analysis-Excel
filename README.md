# Swiggy Funnel Analysis – Product Analytics Project

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on performing funnel analysis for Swiggy to understand user behavior across different stages of the ordering journey. The objective was to measure conversion rates at each funnel stage, identify drop-offs, and generate actionable insights to improve customer conversion and order completion.

The analysis simulates a real-world product analytics scenario where user interactions are tracked from listing views to order placement.

## Tools & Skills Used  
- Microsoft Excel – Data analysis and calculations  
- Business Analytics – Funnel metrics and KPI analysis  
- Product Analytics – User journey and conversion analysis  

## Key Analytics Skills Applied  
- Funnel stage analysis (Listing → Menu → Cart → Payment → Order)  
- Calculating conversion rates (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O, Order/Listing)  
- Identifying drop-off points across funnel stages  
- KPI tracking and performance measurement  
- Translating data into product and business insights  

## Business Questions Explored  
1. How many users move through each stage of the Swiggy funnel?  
2. What is the overall conversion rate from listing to order?  
3. Which funnel stage has the highest user drop-off?  
4. Where should product improvements be prioritized?  
5. How efficient is the payment and checkout flow?  
6. What percentage of users complete an order?  

## Answers to Business Questions  

1. User volume decreases at each stage, indicating natural drop-offs across the funnel.  

2. The overall conversion rate highlights that only a fraction of users who view listings finally place orders.  

3. The highest drop-off is observed between menu and cart stages, indicating friction in product selection or pricing.  

4. Product improvements should focus on menu experience and cart engagement to improve conversions.  

5. The payment stage shows relatively higher conversion, suggesting a smooth checkout process.  

6. The final order completion rate provides a baseline KPI for product performance tracking.  

## Key Insights & Outcomes
